# 🎰 Pity Prediction Web App

A simple and stylish web application for simulating gacha "pity" predictions, inspired by **Honkai: Star Rail (HSR)**.

## 🌟 Features

- 🎮 Dropdown to select a game (currently only supports **HSR**).

  - Includes character, game, and pity.
  - Stored locally via `localStorage`.
  - Includes **Reset** button to clear history.

## 📁 Structure

- `index.html` – The full app (HTML, CSS, JS in one file)

2. Select a game and character.
3. Click the predict button and watch the pity roll!
4. View your results in the history panel.
5. Clear history with the **Reset** button if needed.
